**SaaS Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning**

**Project Description:**

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform using Machine Learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the scenario where a customer discontinues using a company's service. The ability to accurately predict churn is crucial for businesses as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
We have built a predictive ML model using the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which contains customer behavioral data, service usage patterns, and billing information. The model helps in identifying customers who are likely to stop using the service, enabling businesses to take preventive actions such as personalized offers or retention strategies.

**Problem Statement:**

SaaS companies often face challenges in customer retention due to:

Lack of understanding of customer behavior

No early warning system for possible churn

Revenue loss due to unexpected customer exits

The aim of this project is to develop an intelligent churn prediction system that can analyze customer data and provide early churn risk alerts.

**Dataset Used:**

Dataset: WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv

Contains fields like:

Demographics (Gender, SeniorCitizen, Dependents, Partner)

Account Info (Tenure, Contract, Payment Method, Total Charges)

Service Usage (Internet Service, Online Security, Streaming TV, etc.)

Target Variable: Churn (Yes / No)
