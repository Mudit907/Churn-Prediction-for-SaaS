**SaaS Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning**

**Project Description:**

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform using Machine Learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the scenario where a customer discontinues using a company's service. The ability to accurately predict churn is crucial for businesses as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
We have built a predictive ML model using the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which contains customer behavioral data, service usage patterns, and billing information. The model helps in identifying customers who are likely to stop using the service, enabling businesses to take preventive actions such as personalized offers or retention strategies.
